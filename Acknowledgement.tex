

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to undertake this internship at SLB Crawley, where I had the chance to work on this exciting deep learning project. I am especially grateful for the invaluable support and wisdom from the industry shared by my supervisors, Dr. Rajiv Kumar and Dr. Massimiliano Vassallo. I never imagined that I could contribute to two provisional patents and present my work at an internal conference. Their kindness and generosity were instrumental in these achievements.
\\\\
I am also deeply grateful to my academic supervisor, Dr. Dirk-Jan van Manen, for his prompt and constructive feedback on my thesis.
\\\\
A special thanks goes to my friends Anson, Ryan, Sargun, Karla, Ashley, and Winky for their enormous support through countless days and nights, especially during challenging times. Additionally, I would like to thank Konsta and my parents for their unwavering faith and constant support.
